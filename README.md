# Protein-Folding-Prediction-Model
The model simulates protein folding by combining Dynamic Programming (DP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to predict realistic, biologically plausible structures. It utilizes physics-based properties such as hydrophobicity, charge, and spatial distance to estimate and optimize energy-efficient folding pathways.
